# Bing Ads Block

This repository contains views and explores used for the Bing Ads Block dashboards. There are 5 dashboards that come with this block: Bing Adwords Overview, Bing Adwords - Clicks, Bing Adwords - Conversions, Bing Adwords - Impressions and Bing Adwords - Spend. Each of the dashboards provides in-depth analysis of ad/campaign performance over a given timeframe.

This project is remotely included through the Bing Ads Block Config project.
To pull updates from this project, update the `ref:` parameter in the manifest file. It should point to the latest commit in [block-facebook-ads](https://github.com/looker/block-facebook-ads/commits/master).

The LookML constants are used to specify the name of the schema and connection. They are defined in the Bing Ads Block Config project.
